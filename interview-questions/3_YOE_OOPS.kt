1. What are the four pillars of OOP?
-> Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism


2. Explain Encapsulation with an example in Kotlin.
-> privatizing properties and access and control them via class methods
-> Ex. POJO class in Java


3. What is inheritance in OOP? How is it achieved in Kotlin?
-> When class extends its public or protected properties and behaviour to other class, thats called inheritance
-> class can extends by open keyword


4. What is polymorphism? Explain with an example.
-> It allows to perform single action in different ways
-> Class having multiple methods having same name with different param. called method overloading
-> child class extends exact behaviour of parent class called method overriding


5. What is abstraction? How can you achieve it in Kotlin?
-> abstraction is hiding implementation details and expose essential feature


6. How does Kotlin handle multiple inheritances of interfaces?
-> class implement multiple interface at once, but it need super<InterfaceName>.funName(), if all or some interface having same method sign


7. How is method overriding achieved in Kotlin?
-> make method open in parent class and override that method in child class


8. How are abstract classes different from interfaces in Kotlin?
-> abstract and non-abstract method, 
-> variable declaration, initialization
-> override methods

9. What is the difference between an object and a class in Kotlin?

10. What is the purpose of super keyword in Kotlin?  X 2

11. What is the difference between Overloading and Overriding?

12. 10. What is the difference between a class and an object?

13. What is a constructor in OOP?

14. What is an abstract class?
-> An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and can have both abstract (unimplemented) and non-abstract methods.

13. What is an interface?
-> Collection of declared abstract methods and body of methods which implemted by class 

14. What is multiple inheritance in OOP?
-> Single class inherites more than one class, Kotlin doesnot support it becoz of ambiguity


15. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?


16. What are access modifiers in OOP?
-> Public, Private, Protected, Internal

17. What is composition in OOP?
-> Composition is a design principle where a class is composed of one or more objects from other classes. It promotes a "has-a" relationship.
-> it is a 'Has-A' relationship ()


18. What is aggregation?
-> Aggregation is a weaker form of composition where the composed objects can exist independently of the parent.


19. What is association?
->Association describes the relationship between two separate classes that can work together.


20. What is dependency injection?


21. What is method hiding?
-> Method hiding occurs when a subclass defines a method with the same signature as a static method in the parent class. The parent method gets hidden.


22. What is covariance and contravariance in OOP?
-> Covariance: When a generic type can accept a subclass.
-> Contravariance: When a generic type can accept a superclass.


23. What is method chaining?
-> Method chaining is calling multiple methods on the same object in a single statement.


24. What is an inner class?
-> An inner class is a class defined inside another class, and it has access to its outer class members.



25. What is method overloading?

35. What is method overriding?


37. What is the use of this keyword?


39. What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?
Shallow copy: Copies references to the objects.
Deep copy: Copies the actual objects.


40. What is upcasting and downcasting?
Answer:

Upcasting: Casting a subclass to a superclass.
Downcasting: Casting a superclass back to a subclass.
