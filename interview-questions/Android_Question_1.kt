9. What is the purpose of a Bundle in Android?

10. What is the difference between a Service and an IntentService in Android?
-> Service: 1) Long Running Task | 2)Parent Class of IntentService | 3) Work on Main Thread | 4) Required Manual Stop 
-> IntentServiec: 1) Short Running Task | 2) SubClass of Service | 3) Work on Worker thread | 4) Automatically stops itself


11. What is the difference between a View and a ViewGroup in Android UI development?
-> View: Single UI Element
-> ViewGroup: Collection of UI Elements and Other ViewGroup


12. What is the purpose of XML-based layouts in Android UI development?
-> 1) Lightweight | 2) Human & M/C Readable | 3) Highly Supportive in Android | 4) Devs can seperate UI Design from App Logic


13. How do you create a custom View in Android?
-> Extend View Class and overriding onDraw() method, Defining tag in xml


14. How do you handle different screen densities in Android UI development?
-> mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi,


15. What is a RecyclerView in Android UI development?
-> Replacement of List and GridView, Customizable View, Multiple Layout View, Reuse same ui for next dataset


16. What are some common UI components in Android?
-> TextView, EditText, ImageView, CheckBox, RadioButton


17. What is the purpose of the “match_parent” attribute in Android XML layouts?

 
18. What are some common UI design principles for mobile apps?
-> Simplicity, Consistancy, Feedback, Affordance, Discoverability


19. How can you improve the performance of an Android app’s UI?
-> Uses of Lint Tool | By Reducing Layout Heirarchi | Using RecyclerView | Optimizing Animation and Transition | Using SVG instead of Image


20. What is the purpose of the “dp” (density-independent pixel) unit in Android?
-> dp use to specify dimention to UI element which is independent to device screen


21. What is the purpose of a ViewStub in Android?

22. How do you handle different screen sizes in Android?
-> layout-small, layout-large and layout-xlarge 


23. What is Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture.
-> MVVM (Model View, ViewModel) Architecture
-> It is Design by Google Android to maintain seperation of concern
-> It has 3 component: 1) Model (data classes, business logic) | 2) View (UI) | 3) ViewModel: Interface between Model and View

24. How do you implement the MVVM architecture in an Android app using Jetpack? 
-> We use following component in MVVM Architecture 
-> LiveData: Lifecycle aware observable data holder which reflect changes in observable pattern
-> ViewModel: It Store and Manage UI Related Data, communicate model component and handle config changes
-> DataBinding: IT binds to data source in ViewModel and eleminate use of findviewById()


25. What is dependency injection and how does it improve app architecture?
-> It manage dependency between objects
-> Insted of getting object of class directly, DI provides us object of that class
-> It uses annotation to generate code that provide Dependency to other class
-> It is DAG (Directed Asyclic Graph)
-> It is fully static and compile time dependecy injection
-> 1) Constructor Injection 2) Field Injection


26. Can you explain how the Repository pattern works in Android app development?
-> It manage data from different source (Local, Remote, File, ...) in single place
-> It provides abstrat layer to easy swap between diffrent resources

==========================================================================================

27. What is Retrofit and how does it work?
-> Retrofit is type safe HTTP Client for android 
-> It use to make HTTP quest and handle responce very efficiently
-> It allows developer to declare methods with retrofit annotation 
-> It supports parcing Gson, Moshi, library
-> It also comes with support of Interceptors


28. What is Room and how is it used for data persistence in Android?
-> Room is Part of Android Jetpack library and use to store data locally
-> It is abstract layer of SQLite, and it is lightweight, build top of SQLite
-> It allows to perform query operation
-> Room uses annotation to define Entities and Database singleton object


29. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous network requests in Android?
-> synchronous Network execute on Main thread
-> Asynchronous Network execute on Worker thread without blocking main thread


30. What is the difference between REST and SOAP APIs?
-> REST (Representational State Transfer) | LightWeight | Json | HTTP Methods
-> SOAP (Single Object Access Protocol) | Heavyweight | XML | No HTTP Methods

31. What is JSON? How is it used in Android app development?
-> Javascript Object Notation | Send and Received Data from Server | Serialized and Deserialized | Sharing Object between app components
