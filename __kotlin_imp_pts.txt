- we can write main() fun without any param from kotlin version 1.3
- when you declare any variable that will be NotNull by default i.e you cannot store null init hence Kotlin Saves from NullPointerException mostly
- to making variable nullable '?' is imp Ex. var name : String? = null
- In Inheritance : if any class wants to extends then open it, bydefault any class in kotlin is final or not extendable
- open class makes it extendable and open method makes overridable
- In Kotlin any class and method inside class is final by default
- No need to define var keyword in sub class Constructor if you wants to send that param to super class
